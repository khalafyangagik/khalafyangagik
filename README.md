# ðŸ‘‹ Hello and Welcome!

I started using GitHub on **August 12, 2025**.  
However, the projects and problem solutions in this repository were completed over the past year as part of the **Academy Wave 2.0** program.

During this time, I focused on:
- Solving algorithm and data structure problems
- Learning C# and .NET concepts
- Implementing design patterns and coding best practices

Please note that while my GitHub activity is recent, the work reflects consistent learning and development throughout the program.
